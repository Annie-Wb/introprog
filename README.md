# lunduniversity/introprog

![Build Status](https://github.com/lunduniversity/introprog/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)


This is the repo of a course given by Lund University called "Introduction to Programming" using Scala. The repo contains course material in Swedish and some English along with code examples and libraries used in exercises and labs.

Course homepage (in Swedish): http://cs.lth.se/pgk/

This is on-going work, and the first instance of the course was given in 2016 at Lund University. A new instance of the course is given each fall semester. In 2021 the course migrated to Scala 3.

## How to use this repo

* Download latest stable version of the on-line course material from the [course homepage at Lund University](https://cs.lth.se/pgk/download/)

* Use a cached version or re-compile the latest snapshot version, possibly in an inconsistent state under update, of the most recent version of the course material via LaTeX.Online (if your click triggers a re-compile it may take very long before the pdf is ready; if the server gives timeout then try again later):

  - [compendium1.pdf](https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https://github.com/lunduniversity/introprog&target=compendium/compendium1.tex&command=pdflatex)  with lectures and assignments for the first half of the course, formatted for print.

  - [compendium2.pdf](https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https://github.com/lunduniversity/introprog&target=compendium/compendium2.tex&command=pdflatex)  with lectures and assignments for the second half of the course, formatted for print.

  - [compendium.pdf](https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https://github.com/lunduniversity/introprog&target=compendium/compendium.tex&command=pdflatex)  with both parts above in one pdf formatted for easy screen readability and Ctrl+F search.

  - Thanks to [LaTeX.Online](https://latexonline.cc) for their amazing cloud service!

* Build it locally using `sbt build` as explained in "How to build" below.

* Download a stable, but possibly old, released version course material on the [release page](https://github.com/lunduniversity/introprog/releases) frozen at time of printing. The release page is updated at least before the start of each course instance in August each year.

## How to contribute

### Fork and clone

* Learn the basics about git, especially the "Getting Started" and "Git Basics" sections in this book: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

* Get an account at github if you don't have one already. Recommended user name if in doubt: `firstnamefamilyname` with no capital letters and no hyphens.

* Install git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

* Make a **fork** of lunduniversity/introprog in GitHub to your own GitHub account: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

* **Clone** your fork to your local computer: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/

### Keeping your fork in synch

* If you install the GitHub client (avaliable for Win and Mac but not Linux) called "GitHub desktop" https://desktop.github.com/ you can keep your fork in synch with the upstream repo by a single click in the GUI.

* Otherwise, this is how to pull changes from upstream to your fork with git commands: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

### Making contributions

* If you find a typo or minor issue that is straight-forward to fix you are very welcome to create a pull request directly as explained below. But if your contribution is more significant you should open an issue first and start a discussion about your proposal. In the latter case, click the issue tab at the top of this page.

* Before you change locally, make sure your fork is in synch (see above). Frequently do `git pull` or press the synch button in the GitHub desktop GUI.

* You must check that your fix compiles (to Latex or bytecode) before you commit.

* Whenever you are ready with an incremental change, do `git commit -m "msg"` and then `git push`, or commit in the GUI and press the synch button. Think carefully about your commit message, as discussed in the next section.

* When you are ready with a contribution that is good enough to be incorporated in upstream, then create a pull request: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

* Keep your pull requests minimal and coherent to create a small change sets that will be easy to merge as a single unit. Don't pack a lot of unrelated changes in the same pull request. Take a look [here](https://github.com/lunduniversity/introprog/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) for examples of previously accepted pull requests.

* Don't include pdf:s or binaries in the pull request. The maintainers will recompile the repo after your pull request has been merged. You can then checkout your pdf:s before you synch with upstream.


### Writing commit messages

* Write concise and informative [commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) that explains why the commit was made.
* Start each commit message with a direct verb, preferably one of the following:
  * `add` when you have created new stuff that was not there before
  * `update` when you have changed existing stuff
  * `fix` when you have corrected a bug or fixed a typo etc.
  * `remove` when you have removed stuff
  * `rename` when you have renamed files or other stuff without changing appearance/meaning
  * `refactor` when you have changed things structurally but not changed actual appearance/meaning
* Example of commit messages
  * `git commit -am "update exercise w03 to improve explanation"`
  * `git commit -am "add task in exercises w05 vector copy"`
* Make small commits and commit often. Try to keep commits atomic and only within one file if meaningful.
* Make sure your change compiles before committing. Do *not* push code that does not compile!


### Coding style

When learning how to program it is more important to write *something* and start experimenting in a playful way, than to forcefully adhere to a particular coding standard; but students should also (eventually) understand the benefits of having a coding standard.

In this course we pragmatically follow these style guides:

* Scala style:
  * The Scala style guide: http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/
  * A Scala best practice guide: https://github.com/alexandru/scala-best-practices
* Java style:
  * http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf

When you make contributions to code in this repo and when you review pull-requests, check that the contributions follow the above guidelines pragmatically. In particular, **lab assigments stubs** and **answers to exercises** should, if there are no special reasons not to, follow the above style guides.

Here are some other inspiring style guides that illustrate the variety in what different organisations impose:
* Scala:
  * http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/
  * https://github.com/databricks/scala-style-guide
  * https://github.com/paypal/scala-style-guide
* Java:
  * https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html
  * https://wiki.eclipse.org/Coding_Conventions
  * https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/Java+Coding+Guidelines

### Latex guide

* Make sure you have your TeX editor set to UTF-8 encoding. If you get strange errors in relation to Swedish characters, this is likely due to problems relating to non-UTF-8 encodings on Mac or Windows. Linux usually works out-of-the-box.


* Install [texlive-full](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) to get all extra latex stuff that is needed to compile the tex code in this repo. If you don't know which tex editor to use, try [texworks](https://www.tug.org/texworks/).

* For Mac OSX users: there are some problems with El-Capitan and TeX. For some users there are problems compiling .tex-files in the terminal out of the box. You may get this error message: 'mktexpk: No such file or directory' or similar. Using TeXShop to compile the document seems to resolve the issue. To configure TeXShop correctly on El-Capitan, follow the guide https://www.tug.org/mactex/UpdatingForElCapitan.pdf

* Check out the `.cls` files in `compendium/` and `slides/` that provide many useful latex commands.
  * [compendium.cls](https://github.com/lunduniversity/introprog/blob/master/compendium/compendium.cls)
  * [lecturenotes.cls](https://github.com/lunduniversity/introprog/blob/master/slides/lecturenotes.cls)

* Check out some similar, already written `.tex` document and compare with the compiled `.pdf` to see the commands and conventions we use.

* Some custom latex commands in our .cls files:
  * `\begin{Code}` ... `\end{Code}` and `\scalainputlisting{examples/hello-app.scala}` are used for Scala code
  * `\begin{Code}[language=Java]` ... `\end{Code}` and `\javainputlisting{examples/Hi.java}` are used for Java code
  * `\begin{Slide}` and `\end{Slide}` defined in `slides/lecture-notes.cls` and in `compendium/compendium.cls` is used to generate beamer slides and to generate framed text in compendium chapters together with lecture notes that appear after each slide.
